⚡ Logic Gate Simulation – Shows how boolean logic gates determine your BMI category.

🌗 Dark/Light Theme Toggle – Sleek UI that adapts to your visual preference.

📈 Dynamic Results Display – Animated BMI gauge, health insights, and category highlights.

💾 Calculation History – Keeps track of all previous BMI calculations.

📤 Export Option – Save your data easily.

💡 Health Tips Section – Provides general wellness guidance and recommendations.

🧠 Logic Gate Implementation

Each BMI category is determined using digital logic operations that mimic hardware logic design principles.

Logic Gate	                  Function	                                      Usage in BMI Calculator
AND	                 True when both inputs are true	               Used to verify BMI ranges (e.g., Normal if BMI ≥18.5 AND BMI <25)
OR	                 True if either input is true	                 Used for combining health status checks
NOT	                 Inverts a signal	                             Used to negate underweight/obese states
XOR	                 True if exactly one input is true	           Used to differentiate between exclusive BMI categories
NAND	               NOT of AND	                                   Ensures mutually exclusive conditions
NOR	                 NOT of OR	                                   Confirms that no BMI signal is active


📊 BMI Category Reference
Category	BMI Range	Health Indicator
Underweight	< 18.5	     ⚠️ Needs improvement
Normal	    18.5 - 24.9	 ✅ Healthy
Overweight	25 - 29.9	   ⚠️ Caution advised
Obese	      ≥ 30	       ❌ High health risk
